By YJ Yoon, Kon Yoo, Tony Kwon, Jiwoo Seo

_1st Iteration_
### What user stories were completed this iteration?
* Users can order customized salad in command lines. 
* Users can make multiple orders after orders. 
* Some items have limited quantity. If there's no stock, users are prompted to make other choice.

### What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
* We need to implement other customizable items (such as drizzles, drinks) and allow more creativity to users.
* Prettier receipts with String Formatter
* The menu will adjust to the user's diet/allergies.
* There will be an extra charge If the customer ordered two or more protein.
* We want to count every selling profit by each customer to show how much we sold for a given period of time.

### Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
* We are trying to make our code as neat as possible - So some concerns arise in constructing classes and inner-classes.

### What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
* To run our program, the user must run main.java located in LettuceChoose/src
* At the root folder, run:
         
      ./script.sh
* The user will be prompted to answer a set of questions to order a bowl of salad
* Below is an screenshot of a sample order
